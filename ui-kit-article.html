            <p>If read a book set on the continent of Africa over the past couple decades,  a good chance that an acacia tree was on the cover. A perceptive reader of the Africa is a Country blog tweeted an image of 36 book covers featuring the tree. While the acacia tree is lovely, one tree cannot represent an entire continent. The biodiversity of African countries is tremendous, and the Rainforest Alliance is proud to do work in several of them, including Kenya and Ghana. 21px 72 characters</p>


            <h3>Peento Tree (Peaches of Immortality)</h3>
            <p>In Chinese mythology, peaches from the peento tree are known as peaches of immortality. Legend has it that goddess Xiwangmu had 3,600 peento trees on her estate in the hills of Western China. Anyone who ate the peento peach from her trees was given eternal life. The catch? The enchanted fruit was said to ripen every 3,000th; 6,000th; and 9,000th year, and Xiawangmu was not one to dole out her treasure.  Today, mere mortals can enjoy the sweet juiciness of peento peaches without worrying about getting on the bad side of a goddess.</p>

            <br><h3>The Tree of Hope h3</h3>
            <p>During the 1920s and 1930s, a stretch of Seventh Avenue in Harlem was lined with theaters and nightclubs. An elm tree sprouted there and entertainers took to rubbing the tree for luck. It got the nickname the Tree of Hope. When the tree was chopped down in 1934 to widen the street, a portion of it was placed at the Apollo Theater. Today, contestants at the venues Amateur Night rub the Tree of Hope before taking the stage in front of the Apolos notoriously tough crowd. Famous entertainers like Lauryn Hill, Luther Vandross, and Dave Chappelle all lost the competition in the early stages of their now-legendary careers.</p>

            <p>Parents are notorious for saying that money does not grow on trees. Well, in the case of the money tree house plant that phrase still holds true. Unfortunately, the money tree does not sprout currency. However, according to legend, the plants lushness and preponderance of leaves are supposed to directly correlate to the owners financial well-being. In its natural habit in the wetlands of Central and South America, the pachira aquatica can grow up to 60 feet tall. As a houseplant, its growth is dependent upon the size of the pot. Plant and prosper.</p>

It can grow up to 200 feet tall and can be found in many lands, from Mexico to the Amazon to West Africa. Some varieties of the ceiba tree are characterized by spines or conical thorns, giving the tree a menacing appearance.</p>
